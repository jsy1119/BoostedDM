Changes to paper prior to re-submission.

 * Reference to Beacom paper added in footnote 1.
 * Footnote 2 added to address question concerning charged mesons.
 * Added footnote 4, specifying the origin of BR(eta→pi chi chi).

Things to modify.
 * Modify plots using the correct values for the branching ratios as specified in the text.
 * Fig. 1: BR's should specify the decay considered (BR(eta→pi chi chi) instead of BR(eta→chi chi)). [JA: Done.]
 * Fig. 2 (bottom): The upper limit for the x-axis should not go over 5*10^-3.
The notation BR(M→M' chi chi) is misleading as M' is not necessarily another meson (as in the case for pion decay). I'd suggest BR(M→X chi chi) as an alternative (changing the text accordingly).
